# ScreamingFrog Docker

WIP to provide headless screaming frogs.

Contains a Docker installation of the CLI for headless ScreamingFrog applications to be used via its new in version 10 [Command Line Interface](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/user-guide/general/#command-line).

`docker build https://github.com/iihnordic/screamingfrog-docker`

Or submit to Google Build Triggers, which will host it for you privately.

TBD: adding your license key via the `license.conf`
